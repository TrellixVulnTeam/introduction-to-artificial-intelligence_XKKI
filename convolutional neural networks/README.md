## Assignment Goals:

- Compare creating a CNN to a basic neural network as in the "neural networks" assignment
- Design your own deep network for scene recognition

## Assignment Summary:
Your implementation in this assignment might take one or two hours to run. We highly recommend to start working on this assignment early! In this homework, we will explore building deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using PyTorch. Helper code is provided in this assignment and can be downloaded from this zip file code_hw7-2.

In this HW, you are still expected to use the Pytorch backend and virtual environment for programming where you can find the tutorials in the "neural networks" assignment.
